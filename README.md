Project Requirements
Form Creation and Layout:
Use Bootstrapâ€™s form components to create a registration form with fields for First Name, Last Name, Email, Password, and a checkbox for agreeing to terms.
Apply Bootstrap grid layout to position the First Name and Last Name fields side-by-side.
Use validation classes to ensure the Email and Password fields are required.
Add a submit button styled with btn-success.
Table for Displaying Data:
Create a Bootstrap table to display user data.
Hard-code sample data into the table to simulate user submissions.
Apply striped and hoverable rows to enhance readability.
Make the table responsive by wrapping it in a table-responsive div.
Image and Button Utilities:
Add a responsive image using the img-fluid class and place it inside a fluid container to stretch across the page.
Below the main image, add a circular image (rounded-circle).
Create two buttons:
One button should be visible on all screen sizes.
The second button should be hidden on small screens using responsive utilities (d-none and d-md-block).
Responsive Navigation Bar:
Build a navbar with links to Home, About, and Contact sections.
Ensure the navbar collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
Use Bootstrap utilities and components to style the navbar.
Responsiveness and Layout:
Use Bootstrap containers (container or container-fluid) to structure the layout.
Ensure that all components are responsive across different screen sizes using media queries and Bootstrap utilities.
